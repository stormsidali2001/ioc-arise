# Scope Example - JSDoc @scope Feature

This example demonstrates IoC Arise's powerful **JSDoc @scope feature** that allows you to control service lifecycles using simple JSDoc annotations. Learn how to create singleton and transient services and understand their behavior differences.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to use `@scope singleton` and `@scope transient` JSDoc tags
- Difference between singleton and transient service lifecycles
- How scoped services interact with each other
- Practical examples of state management in different scopes

## 📋 Example Contents

### Services Overview

1. **SingletonService** (`@scope singleton`)
   - Created once and reused throughout the application
   - Maintains state across multiple calls
   - Perfect for shared resources, caches, or configuration

2. **TransientService** (`@scope transient`)
   - Created fresh for each request
   - No state persistence between calls
   - Ideal for stateless operations or request-specific processing

3. **MixedService** (`@scope singleton`)
   - Demonstrates how singleton services can depend on both singleton and transient services
   - Shows dependency injection patterns with different scopes

## 🔧 JSDoc Scope Annotations

> **Important:** By default, all classes in IoC Arise are injected with **singleton scope**. You only need to explicitly specify the scope when you want a different behavior.

### Default Behavior (Singleton)
```typescript
/**
 * This class will be singleton by default (no @scope annotation needed)
 */
export class DefaultService {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Explicit Singleton Scope
```typescript
/**
 * A singleton service that maintains state across the application lifecycle.
 * @scope singleton
 */
export class SingletonService implements ISingletonService {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Transient Scope
```typescript
/**
 * A transient service that is created fresh for each request.
 * @scope transient
 */
export class TransientService implements ITransientService {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## 🚀 Running the Example

1. **Generate the IoC container:**
   ```bash
   npx @notjustcoders/ioc-arise generate --source .
   ```

2. **Run the demonstration:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx demo.ts
   ```

## 📊 Expected Output

The demo will show:

### Singleton Behavior
- Same instance ID across multiple calls
- State persistence (counter increments)
- Single creation log message

### Transient Behavior
- Different instance IDs for each call
- Fresh instances with no shared state
- Multiple creation log messages

### Mixed Service Behavior
- Singleton MixedService maintains same instance
- Singleton dependencies are reused
- Transient dependencies are recreated for each operation

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### Default Scope Behavior
- **All classes are singleton by default** - no annotation required
- Only use `@scope` annotations when you need different behavior
- This design promotes efficient resource usage and shared state management

### Singleton Services (Default)
- **Lifecycle:** Created once, reused forever
- **State:** Persistent across the application
- **Annotation:** `@scope singleton` (optional, as it's the default)
- **Use Cases:** 
  - Database connections
  - Configuration services
  - Caches and shared resources
  - Logging services

### Transient Services
- **Lifecycle:** Created fresh for each request
- **State:** No persistence between calls
- **Annotation:** `@scope transient` (required to override default)
- **Use Cases:**
  - Request processors
  - Data transformers
  - Stateless calculators
  - One-time operations

### Dependency Injection with Scopes
- Singleton services can depend on both singleton and transient services
- Transient dependencies are recreated each time the singleton is accessed
- Singleton dependencies are reused across all operations

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Leverage Default Behavior:**
   - Remember that singleton is the default - no annotation needed
   - Only add `@scope transient` when you specifically need fresh instances
   - This keeps your code clean and follows the framework's conventions

2. **Choose the Right Scope:**
   - Use default (singleton) for stateful, shared services
   - Use `@scope transient` for stateless, operation-specific services
   - Consider the lifecycle needs of your service

3. **State Management:**
   - Keep singleton state thread-safe if needed
   - Avoid storing request-specific data in singletons
   - Use transients for request-scoped or operation-specific state

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Singletons (default) are more memory efficient for shared resources
   - Transients provide better isolation but use more memory
   - Consider the creation cost vs. memory usage trade-off

5. **Testing:**
   - Singletons may require state cleanup between tests
   - Transients provide natural isolation for testing
   - Consider using transient scope for test-specific services
